xy shift puts corrected points in correct place. points between then not. where vehicle went aroung U shape.





move linestringM so that specified m,left_offset at points.
new length ~ old length
minimize: length difference, distance to 

new linestring shouldn't have gaps. shifts should be continous?

points not that far from original linestring. ~10m
chainage shift could be ~50m



if only 1 correction move to closest chainage.
if more than 1 



forward shift and perpendicular shift?

can send images around bend properly? no need to find chainages

still problem with 








select m,left_offset,pt
,(select Line_Interpolate_Point(line,(m-start_m)/(end_m-start_m)) from lines limit 1) as old_pt
from corrections_m
