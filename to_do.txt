frames containing bounds of raster images are contained in file with name like '%Spatial Frame Data%' in name
want automated way to load these and apply formatting.

want to make table of 
	RunID
	FromFrame: first frame of run. spinbox with option to select from layer with frames
	toFrame: last frame of run. . spinbox with option to select from layer with frames
	run start
	run end
	
add 
	run start
	run end 
	columns to runs table
	
add file name to display as tool is partly for editing raster image load files


want to create new raster image load files from this or edit existing.
something to scroll through frames in order would be useful


select from frame Layer.
    add dialog to set layer and anything else required.
    add 'load selected frames' button
    
    
each image has frame.
Can get these from txt file or directly from geotif 
getting this from geotif more direct and foolproof but slower


store in spatialite:
        

single table simpler. details: info_to_load,load bool, frame geometry(polygon)
some ui to filter.


questions:
rotating images through gdalwarp using time and disk space, benifits?
display multiple runs vs display 1?


actions:
    select from layer: sets load = true where matches selected features of layer. image_details menu
    select none: set load=false for all images.    
    select action. context menu of view.



show 1 run at time.
    load: loads all images where load=True. button.
    select images between ids: sets load = true where run = run and start<image_id<=end. image_details menu
    
vs    
    show selected runs:
   load: loads all images where load=True. button.
   select images between ids: sets load = true where run in runs and start<image_id<=end. image_details menu   
   select action. context menu of view.
