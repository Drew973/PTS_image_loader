spline interpolation causing problems?


create/load database explicitly on starting plugin?

constraints:
	start of image should be end of last image.
	image width should be ~ constant (gradient effects?)


alternative to QSqlTableModel with sqlite3?
    create application defined functions. not that useful as can't use in views,triggers,constraints...
    use more recent sqlite version? seems same.

run:
	number text unique
	uncorrected_start_chainage
	uncorrected_end_chainage
	line geometry(linestring)


might want to switch to using gps shapefile.
view with lines?

only need corrected centerline to find gcps.
m,corrected_x,corrected_y


image shape:
	collator treats as rectangle. causes some warping at corners.
	trapezium? 
	polygon?
	

corrections:
	move centerline so that specified m,offset at x,y
	want to shift image along vehicle path ie chainage shift.	
	collator uses 1 chainage shift + offset shift/run.
	possible to get best chainage shift for group of corrections.
	for collator m correction for next run tends to be opposite sign. implies x,y shift needed
	chainages from shapefile(from geometry) higher than csv
	csv appears to have more accurate chainages.
	try chainage,offset shift per correction.

	choosing between possible new chainages for correction?
	minimize distance to neiboring corrections?
	

dialog for chainage shift from point?
	QComboxBox of chainage,offset within distance.
	display linestring from start to new chainage. QgsRubberBand.
	
	
runs vs no runs:
	could have 1 shift/offset per run like collator does
	better if don't need to spend time splitting into runs
		
		
finding chainage,offset <-> x,y:

need to define direction for offset.

	depends on what path does between known points.
	smooth path can be cublic spline.
	has continous derivitive.
	Causing problems due to lack of smoothing?
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
GCP from centerline:
	are offsets needed? try just centerline.






gps_model.
	handle all geospatial parts?
	spatialite vs sqlite vs scipy interp1d
	
	
	
	define perpendicular direction by making vector from m+-d



	left_offset = dot_product(perp,shortest_line)
