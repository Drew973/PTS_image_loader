test with athens data. seems ok so far.
Martyn already did these runs:
17-07
17-08
20-09


test unwarped COG and worldfile/ warped VRT

use name instead of number for runs? reduce need to renumber and remake VRT if adding runs before existing.
group by name,image_type . 2 runs with same name can become same VRT


corrections table. starts with 0 chainage,0 offset at start/end of gps data.
map corrected chainage to uncorrected
select corrections to process between.
still need way to filter out unwanted areas. split into runs. do corrections as seperate table/process.


raw gps data in anpp file.
lcmsdata made by hawkeye


store spline coefficients in database? like min_m,max_m,x0,x1,x2,y0,y1,y2...


gui updated and events handled by QApplication.processEvents() or when not in method/function.
start tasks and use modal QProgressDialog where appropriate
if the progress dialog is modal setValue() calls QCoreApplication::processEvents()
emiting signal causes connected slots to happen immediately, not before leaving function that emitted it.


patterns:
	as procedural as possible. makes testing easier.
	backend should raise errors where problem.
	ui/ frontend should use try/except and display error message where problem.
	gdal cli preferable to python bindings as better documented (and faster?)

	functions get/set state of database.
	models read and display only?

	use QSettings instead of looking up settings from ui and passing args
	
	list of 10000 inactive QProcess uses <1Mb memory.



trigger when start/end changed that changes rows where range overlaps.

find dead code with 
vulture C:\Users\drew.bennett\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins\image_loader/image_loader_dockwidget.py C:\Users\drew.bennett\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins\image_loader


local file. Postgis might make collaboration easier.
spatialite is buggy piece of crap
want sql style queries though.
shapefile? performance?
fileLocks?


create/load database explicitly on starting plugin?

constraints:
	start of image should be end of last image.
	image width should be ~ constant (gradient effects?)


alternative to QSqlTableModel with sqlite3?
    create application defined functions. not that useful as can't use in views,triggers,constraints...
    use more recent sqlite version? seems same.


might want to switch to using gps shapefile.
view with lines?


corrections:
	mo best as gps tends to lag.

runs vs no runs:
	could have 1 shift/offset per run like collator does
	better if don't need to spend time splitting into runs
		
	
test out loading gps from geom.csv
	see if any more accurate

store gcps and only gereference where changed or image doesn't exist?

Qgis not releasing file locks.
	use iface.addVectorLayer() instead of QgsVectorLayer?
	

include frame in correction?
	preview button and filePath combobox to remake and reload image.


read hawkeye database?
need ms sql server? how is it currently being done?
0.4 GB vs 4.8 Gb of hawkeye exported xml files + time
