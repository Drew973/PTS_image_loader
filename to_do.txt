frames containing bounds of raster images are contained in file with name like '%Spatial Frame Data%' in name
want automated way to load these and apply formatting.

want to make table of 
	RunID
	FromFrame: first frame of run. spinbox with option to select from layer with frames
	toFrame: last frame of run. . spinbox with option to select from layer with frames
	run start
	run end
	
add 
	run start
	run end 
	columns to runs table
	
add file name to display as tool is partly for editing raster image load files


use spinBox delegate with min and max for start and end id columns


cracking data(text file,same folder as frames and txt)
load spatial Crack Data.txt


want to create new raster image load files from this or edit existing.
something to scroll through frames in order would be useful



select from frame Layer.
    add dialog to set layer and anything else required.
    add 'load selected frames' button
    
    
each image has frame.
Can get these from txt file or directly from geotif 
test getting this from geotif. more direct and foolproof


save as geopackage.



single table simpler. details: info_to_load,load bool, frame geometry(polygon)
some ui to filter.
