Tool to make .vrt file for each run in corrections csv from corresponding images in folder.
Also makes overviews. Making overviews is time consuming but speeds up rendering in QGIS.


may need to run
py3_env if getting python not recognised as command...



Intended to be used from OSGeo4W shell like
python [vrt_from_corrections.py] [folder with images] [corrections csv] 
Eg
python "C:\Users\drew.bennett\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins\image_loader\vrt_from_corrections.py" "D:\RAF Shawbury\TIF Images\MFV1_005\ImageRng" "D:\RAF Shawbury\Processed Data\MFV1_005 Coordinate Corrections.csv"

vrt and overviews will be created in folder.
VRT files can be loaded into QGIS in same way as other rasters.
